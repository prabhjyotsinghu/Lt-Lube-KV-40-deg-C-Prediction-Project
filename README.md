# Light-Lube-Product-KV-40-deg-C-Prediction-Python-Project

In this project, I have used Regression models to predict Light Lube Flow/Production. This is basically the middle cut of the final distillation column of my Lube Oil Base Stock Plant (Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Mumbai Refinery).

Input features used are those on which Light Lube Flow depends and Kinematic Viscosity (KV@40 deg C) is the target/output variable.

This model benefited the industry by eliminating the need to buy external KV physical analyzer for this product which could cost around 30 Lakh INR (including analyzer and installtion cost) because the model is predicting the same that the analyzer does. 

Have a look.

Thanks !!
