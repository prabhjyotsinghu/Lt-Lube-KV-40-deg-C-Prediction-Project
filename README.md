# Light-Lube-Product-KV-40-deg-C-Prediction-Python-Project

In this project, used Regression models to predict Light Lube Flow/Light Lube Production. This is basically the middle cut of the final distillation column of Lube Oil Base Stock Plant i which I was working. Input features used are those on which Light Lube Product Kinematic Viscosity depends and Kinematic Viscosity of the same product (Kinematic Viscosity @40 deg C) is the target/output variable.

This model benefited the industry by eliminating the need to buy external KV physical analyzer for this product which could cost around 30 Lakh INR (including analyzer and installtion cost) because the model is predicting the same that the analyzer will do.
